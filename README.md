# AI-Security-Scanner
This project focuses on building an AI-assisted security scanner for Python code designed to identify potential vulnerabilities, insecure patterns, and risky coding practices that could be exploited in real-world applications.

The goal of this project is twofold:

To explore how artificial intelligence can be applied to software security, beyond traditional rule-based scanning.

To develop a deeper understanding of common Python security vulnerabilities, such as unsafe input handling, insecure dependencies, and logic flaws that can lead to exploitation.

Through this project, I am learning how static code analysis, security heuristics, and AI-driven pattern recognition can work together to improve code safety. This scanner is intended as a learning-focused tool that evolves over time, with plans to expand detection capabilities, improve accuracy, and integrate more advanced analysis techniques.

I am particularly interested in this project because I want to pursue software security and secure systems development, and this serves as a hands-on way to build practical security intuition while strengthening my Python and AI skills.
